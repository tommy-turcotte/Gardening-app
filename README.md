## Project and App Overview
This website is a data-centric application whose purpose is to aid gardeners and farmers in managing their planted crops and making optimal horticulture decisions. Please see the `Pages and System Functions` section further down this page for more details on the site’s modules. 

### Important notes 
- Our group focused a lot of our efforts into developing the backend and the database; as such, some of the functionality it provides is not reflected in the frontend yet. We hope that this—as well as the complexity of our server—is taken into account for the marking.   
- It is recommended to log in as `user1` (username: `user1`, password: `user1pw`) because this user already has data initialized for several system functions (e.g., a watchlist with multiple locations). 

## Server-side details 
### Installing packages
Ensure you are in the `backend/` directory. 

1. `npm install -g nodemon`
2. `npm install express`
3. `npm install sqlite3`
4. `npm install ml-knn`
5. `npm install md5`

View installed packages using `npm list` (no args shows local packages (e.g., `express` and `sqlite`), `-g` to show global packages).

### How to run 
1. `cd backend/`
2. `nodemon` 

The backend runs on port `4321`. 

### Database initialization 
This project uses SQLite; thus, the database is stored as a single `.db` file (`backend/data/database.db`). It is pre-filled (i.e., all tables contain records), so it will work out-of-the-box (no initialization necessary). As previously stated, it is suggested to log in as `user1` to take full advantage of the database. 

### Recommended tools 
1. DB Browser for SQLite: track entire database state in real time. 
2. Postman: provides a much better interface for hitting endpoints and communicating with the backend server directly. Recommended to try out endpoints that are not called by the frontend. 

### Note on location data 
A considerable portion of the pre-built database consists of location data generated using the `data/location_recs.json` file. The dataset used to create this file can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharthss/crop-recommendation-dataset). 

## Front-end details
### Installing packages
Ensure you are in the `frontend/` directory. 

1. `npm install -g @vue/cli`
2. `npm install bulma`
3. `npm install axios`
4. `npm install md5`

### How to run
First ensure that the backend server is running. 

1. `cd frontend/`
2. `npm run serve`

The frontend runs on port `8080`.
